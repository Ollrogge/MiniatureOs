#![no_std]
#![no_main]
//! This module contains the master boot record code (stage1). This code executes in real mode.
//! There is only 446 bytes space for the code so not much can be done.
//! Tasks:
//!     - Load second stage into memory and jump to it
//!
//! Some Notes on real mode:
//!     - NOT 16 bit. 32 bit registers are accessible (Operand Size Override Prefix)
//!     - real = all addresses correspond to real locations in memory
//!     - access to BIOS functions
//!     - Segment registers = contents interpreted as the most significant 16
//!     bits of a linear 20-bit address
//!     - no support for memory protection, code privilege levels, paging, multitasking
//!     - segment registers hold direct segment addresses.
//!     - Segmentation: Addressing works based on segment selectors + an offset.
//!     Physical address = segment * 16 + offset. Since both segment and offset
//!     are 16 bit values, the maximum addressable address is 1MiB.
//!     (actually max is 0xFFFFÃ—16 + 0xFFFF=0x10FFEF, which is 1,114,095), but
//!     addresses wrap around so 1MiB is limit
